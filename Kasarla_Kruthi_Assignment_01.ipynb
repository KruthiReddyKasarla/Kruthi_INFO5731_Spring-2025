        "This was an integral assignment in that it tested my Python programming skills in a wide domain such as numerical computations, data analysis, string manipulations, and real-world applications including inventory management and flight booking systems.\n",
        "The most challenging features were how to handle some of the most extreme edge cases, especially on Questions 6 and 7, where an inventory management system and a booking system had to be implemented according to real life. The debugging and structuring of the programs in order for efficiency and accuracy also took a lot of effort.\n",
        "I especially enjoyed Question 5, where there was real-world data from a CSV file. That was nice to extract meaning from it and do some calculation, like the harmonic mean. The calculator program implementation in Question 4 was also quite fun, especially when the extension to higher-level mathematical operations was done.\n",
        "Generally, this was a good assignment that really enforced my problem-solving and coding skills."
