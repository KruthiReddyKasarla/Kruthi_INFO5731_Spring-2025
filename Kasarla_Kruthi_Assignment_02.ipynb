        "This assignment was a great opportunity to apply web scraping, API usage, and text processing techniques to real-world datasets. I found it insightful to work with different sources like GitHub Marketplace, Twitter, and review sites, as it provided hands-on experience in data collection and cleaning.\n",

        "Challenges Faced:\n",

Additionally, cleaning text data required careful preprocessing to remove noise while preserving meaningful information. Setting up API access, especially for Twitter, required proper authentication and managing rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aspects Enjoyed:\n",
        "I enjoyed working with real-world text data and applying NLP techniques such as POS tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition. It was interesting to analyze how different preprocessing steps affected the quality of the final dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time to Complete the Assignment:\n",
        "The given time was manageable, but some tasks, like collecting large datasets and cleaning them, required significant effort. Fortunately, the one-day deadline extension helped me complete the assignment more effectively, allowing extra time for debugging and improving data quality. The structured approach in the assignment also helped in completing it efficiently.\n",
